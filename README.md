# MUSICA

Multi-Scale Infrastructure for Chemistry Modeling

MUSICA is a collection of modeling software, tools, and grids, that
allow for robust modeling of chemistry in Earth's atmosphere.

At present the project encompasses these components
- [TUV-x](https://github.com/NCAR/tuv-x)
    - A photolysis rate calculator 

## Available grids

Pre-made grids for use in MUSICA are available [here](https://wiki.ucar.edu/display/MUSICA/Available+Grids).
